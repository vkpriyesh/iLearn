Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text
Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. It's called lorem ipsum text because those are the first two words of a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, let's use something called kitty ipsum text.

Replace the text inside your p element with the first few words of this kitty ipsum text: Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.

Use a CSS Class to Style an Element
Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.

Here's an example CSS class declaration:

<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag.

You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:

<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. In your HTML elements' class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period.

Inside your style element, change the h2 selector to .red-text and update the color's value from blue to red.

Give your h2 element the class attribute with a value of 'red-text'
