Control Flow and Looping

The blocks of code in a for loop can be as big or as small as they need to be.

While looping, you may want to perform different actions depending on the particular item in the list.

numbers = [1, 3, 4, 7]
for number in numbers: 
    if number > 6:
        print number
print "We printed 7."

    In the above example, we create a list with 4 numbers in it.
    Then we loop through the numbers list and store each item in the list in the variable number.
    On each loop, if number is greater than 6, we print it out. So, we print 7.
    Finally, we print out a sentence.

Make sure to keep track of your indentation or you may get confused!

For One and All
If you want to do something with every item in the list, you can use a for loop. If you've learned about for loops in JavaScript, pay close attention! They're different in Python.

for variable in list_name:
    # Do stuff!
A variable name follows the for keyword; it will be assigned the value of each list item in turn.

Then in list_name designates list_name as the list the loop will work on. The line ends with a colon (:) and the indented code that follows it will be executed once per item in the list.

More with 'for'
If your list is a jumbled mess, you may need to sort() it.

animals = ["cat", "ant", "bat"]
animals.sort()

for animal in animals:
    print animal
First, we create a list called animals with three strings. The strings are not in alphabetical order.
Then, we sort animals into alphabetical order. Note that .sort() modifies the list rather than returning a new list.
Then, for each item in animals, we print that item out as "ant", "bat", "cat" on their own line each.

This Next Part is Key
A dictionary is similar to a list, but you access values by looking up a key instead of an index. A key can be any string or number. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces, like so:

d = {'key1' : 1, 'key2' : 2, 'key3' : 3}
This is a dictionary called d with three key-value pairs. The key 'key1' points to the value 1, 'key2' to 2, and so on.

Dictionaries are great for things like phone books (pairing a name with a phone number), login pages (pairing an e-mail address with a username), and more!

New Entries
Like Lists, Dictionaries are "mutable". This means they can be changed after they are created. One advantage of this is that we can add new key/value pairs to the dictionary after it is created like so:

dict_name[new_key] = new_value
An empty pair of curly braces {} is an empty dictionary, just like an empty pair of [] is an empty list.

The length len() of a dictionary is the number of key-value pairs it has. Each pair counts only once, even if the value is a list. (That's right: you can put lists inside dictionaries!)

Changing Your Mind
Because dictionaries are mutable, they can be changed in many ways. Items can be removed from a dictionary with the del command:

del dict_name[key_name]
will remove the key key_name and its associated value from the dictionary.

A new value can be associated with a key by assigning a value to the key, like so:

dict_name[key] = new_value


Remove a Few Things
Sometimes you need to remove something from a list.

beatles = ["john","paul","george","ringo","stuart"]
beatles.remove("stuart")
print beatles
>> ["john","paul","george","ringo"]
We create a list called beatles with 5 strings.
Then, we remove the first item from beatles that matches the string "stuart". Note that .remove(item) does not return anything.
Finally, we print out that list just to see that "stuart" was actually removed.

It's Dangerous to Go Alone! Take This
Let's go over a few last notes about dictionaries

my_dict = {
    "fish": ["c", "a", "r", "p"],
    "cash": -4483,
    "luck": "good"
}
print my_dict["fish"][0]
In the example above, we created a dictionary that holds many types of values.
The key "fish" has a list, the key "cash" has an int, and the key "luck" has a string.
Finally, we print the letter 'c'. When we access a value in the dictionary like my_dict["fish"], we have direct access to that value. So we can access the item at index '0' in the list stored by the key "fish".

BeFOR We Begin
Before we begin our exercise, we should go over the Python for loop one more time. For now, we are only going to go over the for loop in terms of how it relates to lists and dictionaries. We'll explain more cool for loop uses in later courses.

for loops allow us to iterate through all of the elements in a list from the left-most (or zeroth element) to the right-most element. A sample loop would be structured as follows:

a = ["List of some sort”]
for x in a: 
    # Do something for every x
This loop will run all of the code in the indented block under the for x in a: statement. The item in the list that is currently being evaluated will be x. So running the following:

for item in [1, 3, 21]: 
    print item
would print 1, then 3, and then 21. The variable between for and in can be set to any variable name (currently item), but you should be careful to avoid using the word “list” as a variable, since that's a reserved word (that is, it means something special) in the Python language.

This is KEY!
You can also use a for loop on a dictionary to loop through its keys with the following:

# A simple dictionary
d = {"foo" : "bar"}

for key in d: 
    print d[key]  # prints "bar" 
Note that dictionaries are unordered, meaning that any time you loop through a dictionary, you will go through every key, but you are not guaranteed to get them in any particular order.

Maintaining Order

Sometimes you need to search for an item in a list.

animals = ["ant", "bat", "cat"]
print animals.index("bat")

    First, we create a list called animals with three strings.
    Then, we print the first index that contains the string "bat", which will print 1.

We can also insert items into a list.

animals.insert(1, "dog")
print animals

    We insert "dog" at index 1, which moves everything down by 1.
    We print out ["ant", "dog", "bat", "cat"]

Slicing Lists and Strings

You can slice a string exactly like a list! In fact, you can think of strings as lists of characters: each character is a sequential item in the list, starting from index 0.

my_list[:2]
# Grabs the first two items
my_list[3:]
# Grabs the fourth through last items

If your list slice includes the very first or last item in a list (or a string), the index for that item doesn't have to be included.

List Slicing

Sometimes, you only want to access a portion of a list.

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
slice = letters[1:3]
print slice
print letters

    In the above example, we first create a list called letters.
    Then, we take a subsection and store it in the slice list. We start at the index before the colon and continue up to but not including the index after the colon.
    Next, we print out ['b', 'c']. Remember that we start counting indices from 0 and that we stopped before index 3.
    Finally, we print out ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], just to show that we did not modify the original letters list.

Late Arrivals & List Length

A list doesn't have to have a fixed length. You can add items to the end of a list any time you like!

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
letters.append('d')
print len(letters)
print letters

    In the above example, we first create a list called letters.
    Then, we add the string 'd' to the end of the letters list.
    Next, we print out 4, the length of the letters list.
    Finally, we print out ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].


spending_money = 600
def hotel_cost(nights):
    return 140 * nights

def plane_ride_cost(city):
    if city == "Charlotte":
        return 183
    if city == "Tampa":
        return 220
    if city == "Pittsburgh":
        return 222
    if city == "Los Angeles":
        return 475
        
def rental_car_cost(days):
    cost = days * 40
    if days >= 7:
        cost = cost - 50
    elif days >= 3:
        cost = cost - 20
    return cost
    
def trip_cost(city, days, spending_money):
    return rental_car_cost(5) + hotel_cost(5) + plane_ride_cost("Los Angeles") + spending_money

max()

The max() function takes any number of arguments and returns the largest one. ("Largest" can have odd definitions here, so it's best to use max() on integers and floats, where the results are straightforward, and not on other objects, like strings.)

For example, max(1,2,3) will return 3 (the largest number in the set of arguments).


Here Be Dragons

Universal imports may look great on the surface, but they're not a good idea for one very important reason: they fill your program with a ton of variable and function names without the safety of those names still being associated with the module(s) they came from.

If you have a function of your very own named sqrt and you import math, your function is safe: there is your sqrt and there is math.sqrt. If you do from math import *, however, you have a problem: namely, two different functions with the exact same name.

Even if your own definitions don't directly conflict with names from imported modules, if you import * from several modules at once, you won't be able to figure out which variable or function came from where.

For these reasons, it's best to stick with either import module and type module.name or just import specific variables and functions from various modules as needed.
Instructions

The code in the editor will show you everything available in the math module.

Click Save & Submit Code to check it out (you'll see sqrt, along with some other useful things like pi, factorial, and trigonometric functions).



I Know Kung Fu

Remember import this from the first exercise in this course? That was an example of importing a module. A module is a file that contains definitions—including variables and functions—that you can use once it is imported.

Generic Imports

Did you see that? Python said: "NameError: name 'sqrt' is not defined." Python doesn't know what square roots are—yet.

There is a Python module named math that includes a number of useful variables and functions, and sqrt() is one of those functions. In order to access math, all you need is the import keyword. When you simply import a module this way, it's called a generic import.



Ending Up

Well done! However, now we have the first letter showing up both at the beginning and near the end.

s = "Charlie"

print s[0]
# will print "C"

print s[1:4]
# will print "har"

    First we create a variable s and give it the string "Charlie"
    Next we access the first letter of "Charlie" using s[0]. Remember letter positions start at 0.
    Then we access a slice of "Charlie" using s[1:4]. This returns everything from the letter at position 1 up till position 4.

We are going to slice the string just like in the 3rd example above.


Parameters and Arguments

Let's reexamine the first line that defined square in the previous exercise:

def square(n):

n is a parameter of square. A parameter acts as a variable name for a passed in argument. With the previous example, we called square with the argument 10. In this instance the function was called, n holds the value 10.

A function can require as many parameters as you'd like, but when you call the function, you should generally pass in a matching number of arguments.

python doesn't require any explicit definition for data types.

print function works as simple as <print something>.

funtions are defined as:
	def fnName():
		something over here

SO INDENTATION IS THE KEY TO BOOM BOOM

comments start with #:
	#like this | well this is a single line comment 
	"""but this is a 
		multi line comment lol"""

mathematical operations just go as simple as they can:
	mathSum = 654 + 5644

exponential stuffs go as this:
	something ** to_the_power_something

as usual, the modulo goes like this:
	654 % 1

String formatting works like this:
	print("%.2f" % total)

Strings are defined as :
	someString = "some String. okay?"

Escape characterization is done by \ :
	like this\'s

A character from a string can be fetched using:
	"somestring" [characterIndex]

	where characterIndex is the number position of the desired character from left to right, starting from zero

Number of letters in a string can be found out by:
	len()

For lowering down the case of a string:
	lower()

For upper case of a string:
	upper()

For explicit conversion of a variable:
	str(someVariable or data)

Concatenation of the string can be done as:
	"some string here" + "some here" + "some up here"


STRING FORMATTING :

multiple variables can be defined under:
	"%s1 %s2.... %sn" % (var1, var2, var3.... varN)

upper case can be used as:
	var_name.upper()

"Elif" is short for "else if." It means exactly what it sounds like: "otherwise, if the following expression is true, do this!"

if 8 > 9:
    print "I don't get printed!"
elif 8 < 9:
    print "I get printed!"
else:
    print "I also don't get printed!"
In the example above, the elif statement is only checked if the original if statement if False.
