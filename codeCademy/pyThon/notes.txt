For One and All
If you want to do something with every item in the list, you can use a for loop. If you've learned about for loops in JavaScript, pay close attention! They're different in Python.

for variable in list_name:
    # Do stuff!
A variable name follows the for keyword; it will be assigned the value of each list item in turn.

Then in list_name designates list_name as the list the loop will work on. The line ends with a colon (:) and the indented code that follows it will be executed once per item in the list.

Maintaining Order

Sometimes you need to search for an item in a list.

animals = ["ant", "bat", "cat"]
print animals.index("bat")

    First, we create a list called animals with three strings.
    Then, we print the first index that contains the string "bat", which will print 1.

We can also insert items into a list.

animals.insert(1, "dog")
print animals

    We insert "dog" at index 1, which moves everything down by 1.
    We print out ["ant", "dog", "bat", "cat"]

Slicing Lists and Strings

You can slice a string exactly like a list! In fact, you can think of strings as lists of characters: each character is a sequential item in the list, starting from index 0.

my_list[:2]
# Grabs the first two items
my_list[3:]
# Grabs the fourth through last items

If your list slice includes the very first or last item in a list (or a string), the index for that item doesn't have to be included.

List Slicing

Sometimes, you only want to access a portion of a list.

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
slice = letters[1:3]
print slice
print letters

    In the above example, we first create a list called letters.
    Then, we take a subsection and store it in the slice list. We start at the index before the colon and continue up to but not including the index after the colon.
    Next, we print out ['b', 'c']. Remember that we start counting indices from 0 and that we stopped before index 3.
    Finally, we print out ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'], just to show that we did not modify the original letters list.

Late Arrivals & List Length

A list doesn't have to have a fixed length. You can add items to the end of a list any time you like!

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']
letters.append('d')
print len(letters)
print letters

    In the above example, we first create a list called letters.
    Then, we add the string 'd' to the end of the letters list.
    Next, we print out 4, the length of the letters list.
    Finally, we print out ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].


spending_money = 600
def hotel_cost(nights):
    return 140 * nights

def plane_ride_cost(city):
    if city == "Charlotte":
        return 183
    if city == "Tampa":
        return 220
    if city == "Pittsburgh":
        return 222
    if city == "Los Angeles":
        return 475
        
def rental_car_cost(days):
    cost = days * 40
    if days >= 7:
        cost = cost - 50
    elif days >= 3:
        cost = cost - 20
    return cost
    
def trip_cost(city, days, spending_money):
    return rental_car_cost(5) + hotel_cost(5) + plane_ride_cost("Los Angeles") + spending_money

max()

The max() function takes any number of arguments and returns the largest one. ("Largest" can have odd definitions here, so it's best to use max() on integers and floats, where the results are straightforward, and not on other objects, like strings.)

For example, max(1,2,3) will return 3 (the largest number in the set of arguments).


Here Be Dragons

Universal imports may look great on the surface, but they're not a good idea for one very important reason: they fill your program with a ton of variable and function names without the safety of those names still being associated with the module(s) they came from.

If you have a function of your very own named sqrt and you import math, your function is safe: there is your sqrt and there is math.sqrt. If you do from math import *, however, you have a problem: namely, two different functions with the exact same name.

Even if your own definitions don't directly conflict with names from imported modules, if you import * from several modules at once, you won't be able to figure out which variable or function came from where.

For these reasons, it's best to stick with either import module and type module.name or just import specific variables and functions from various modules as needed.
Instructions

The code in the editor will show you everything available in the math module.

Click Save & Submit Code to check it out (you'll see sqrt, along with some other useful things like pi, factorial, and trigonometric functions).



I Know Kung Fu

Remember import this from the first exercise in this course? That was an example of importing a module. A module is a file that contains definitions—including variables and functions—that you can use once it is imported.

Generic Imports

Did you see that? Python said: "NameError: name 'sqrt' is not defined." Python doesn't know what square roots are—yet.

There is a Python module named math that includes a number of useful variables and functions, and sqrt() is one of those functions. In order to access math, all you need is the import keyword. When you simply import a module this way, it's called a generic import.



Ending Up

Well done! However, now we have the first letter showing up both at the beginning and near the end.

s = "Charlie"

print s[0]
# will print "C"

print s[1:4]
# will print "har"

    First we create a variable s and give it the string "Charlie"
    Next we access the first letter of "Charlie" using s[0]. Remember letter positions start at 0.
    Then we access a slice of "Charlie" using s[1:4]. This returns everything from the letter at position 1 up till position 4.

We are going to slice the string just like in the 3rd example above.


Parameters and Arguments

Let's reexamine the first line that defined square in the previous exercise:

def square(n):

n is a parameter of square. A parameter acts as a variable name for a passed in argument. With the previous example, we called square with the argument 10. In this instance the function was called, n holds the value 10.

A function can require as many parameters as you'd like, but when you call the function, you should generally pass in a matching number of arguments.

python doesn't require any explicit definition for data types.

print function works as simple as <print something>.

funtions are defined as:
	def fnName():
		something over here

SO INDENTATION IS THE KEY TO BOOM BOOM

comments start with #:
	#like this | well this is a single line comment 
	"""but this is a 
		multi line comment lol"""

mathematical operations just go as simple as they can:
	mathSum = 654 + 5644

exponential stuffs go as this:
	something ** to_the_power_something

as usual, the modulo goes like this:
	654 % 1

String formatting works like this:
	print("%.2f" % total)

Strings are defined as :
	someString = "some String. okay?"

Escape characterization is done by \ :
	like this\'s

A character from a string can be fetched using:
	"somestring" [characterIndex]

	where characterIndex is the number position of the desired character from left to right, starting from zero

Number of letters in a string can be found out by:
	len()

For lowering down the case of a string:
	lower()

For upper case of a string:
	upper()

For explicit conversion of a variable:
	str(someVariable or data)

Concatenation of the string can be done as:
	"some string here" + "some here" + "some up here"


STRING FORMATTING :

multiple variables can be defined under:
	"%s1 %s2.... %sn" % (var1, var2, var3.... varN)

upper case can be used as:
	var_name.upper()

"Elif" is short for "else if." It means exactly what it sounds like: "otherwise, if the following expression is true, do this!"

if 8 > 9:
    print "I don't get printed!"
elif 8 < 9:
    print "I get printed!"
else:
    print "I also don't get printed!"
In the example above, the elif statement is only checked if the original if statement if False.
